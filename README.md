# Sorting Visualizer

When I began learning about sorting algorithms, I found it somewhat difficult to grasp what was actually happening and how these algorithms differed in their approaches to sorting. This served as the reasoning behind this project, motivating me to implement algorithms in a visual and interactive way. Check it out [here](https://drewvlaz-sorting-visualizer.netlify.app/)!

Sorting Algorithms Implemented:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort.

_This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)._
