# Sorting Visualizer

The motivation behind this project was to learn about sorting algorithms in a visual and interactive way. A demo is live [here](https://drewvlaz-sorting-visualizer.netlify.app/).

This visualizer implements the following:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
